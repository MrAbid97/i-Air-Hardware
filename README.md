# i-Air-Hardware
The proposed device (i-Air will monitor air quality continuously by generating API values in real time with location details and uploading it to Firebase. Then the proposed mobile app would download the API value, History and GPS data and show those in different pages of the App. Everyone using the App can access these information from anywhere. All of these will be done with the help of two gas sensors and a GPS module. ESP32 is proposed to be the microcontroller in this project. So, it is proposed to do all the logical and arithmetic calculation and upload those data to Firebase. For communication with mobile app and server Wi-Fi will be used.
